# **"Dynamic Few-Shot Visual Learning Without Forgetting"**, Spyros Gidaris, Nikos Komodakis, CVPR2018. [[paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Gidaris_Dynamic_Few-Shot_Visual_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)] [[github](https://github.com/gidariss/FewShotWithoutForgetting)]
* **Motivation** : Generate new weights for few-shot test with pre-trained weights and few-shot data without forgetting pre-trained class category weights. 
* **Method** : 
1. Weight generation with prior training weight and few-shot datas.
2. replace dot product calculation to cosine similarity.
3. Attentional method to generate new weights.
* **Presenter** : Hankyeol Lee
